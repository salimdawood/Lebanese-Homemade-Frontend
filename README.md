# Lebanese Homemade Platform - FRONTEND

The API used for this project is founded [here](https://github.com/salimdawood/Lebanese-Homemade-API).

## Overview

A developer's main work is to find a real world problem and build the solution. Many people from my country(Lebanon) started small businesses as a way to supplement their income as the economic crisis hit. Advertising their products using paid ads or promotions is a real challenge for these small startups, my platform is a free solution for them. `User` can create a profile and start creating cards that contain information about their business(location,social media links) and products(menu,photos) while `Guest` can browse this platform with filter functionality by categories to find their best product with the desired price.

I used ReactsJs for building the front-end platform due to the flexibility this JS framework can provide. This was my first ReactJs project dealing with API and state management at this scale. This caused in implementing some features in a different way and not following the best practices. Many features can be easily added with this scalable JS framework such as `description text`, `confirmation alert`, `search by name`, and `save favorite items`.
